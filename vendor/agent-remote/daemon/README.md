# agentremoted — one daemon, every harness

Python 3, **stdlib only**. Serves agent sessions to Agent Remote clients
(BlackBerry, Android, web) over a token-authenticated HTTP+JSON API and
runs turns via each harness CLI.

**Preferred setup:** one process with

```json
{ "providers": ["claude", "grok", "codex"], "port": 8473 }
```

Clients use **one profile** for that host; new session picks the harness.

## Versioning

Bump `agentremoted/__init__.py` → `__version__` **once per shippable change**
(semver patch for fixes, minor for API/cap changes). Do not micro-bump every
intermediate edit in a single feature. `/api/ping` reports the version so you
can see whether a host picked up a deploy.

**2.9.2** Inbox: BB10 Qt 4.8 `QUrl(QString)` re-encodes an already
percent-encoded path (`%E6` → `%25E6`), so a Chinese filename 404'd. The
daemon now unquotes until stable (still basename-confined), and the BB10
client builds drop URLs with `QUrl::fromEncoded`.
**2.9.1** Inbox download of non-ASCII filenames. `X-Drop-Name` is an HTTP/1
header (latin-1), so a Chinese name used to 500 the whole transfer. The header
is now percent-encoded UTF-8 when needed, and `Content-Disposition` carries
RFC 5987 `filename*`. Android, BlackBerry, and iOS unquote it so the saved
file keeps the original name.
**2.9.0** Permission dialogs reach the clients. Interactive mode runs the
TUI with `--permission-mode bypassPermissions`, which was assumed to remove
prompts; it does not. A `Read()` deny rule arms the static Bash guards
(`cd-compound-read` / `-write` / `-redirect`), and commands whose arguments
cannot be analysed statically ask regardless, so a turn could sit blocked on
a Yes/No with nobody at the pane. There is no hook for these, so the pane is
polled ~1/s while a turn runs, parsed into a question payload
(`_permission_panel`) and published on the existing `pending_question`
channel — so the web, Android and BlackBerry clients show it with no client
change — then the pick is typed back with Down/Enter. Two guards matter: a
dialog with output below it is treated as already answered (typing there
would hit a live prompt), and an AskUserQuestion panel is skipped so the two
handlers never race for the same keystrokes. Cancel, timeout and an
unrecognised answer all send Escape, declining that one tool call instead of
wedging the TUI. Covered by `tests/permission_panel_test.py`.

**2.8.13** Guest Live TUI actually starts. Headless grok was dying with
`Operation not permitted (os error 1)` because `--cwd` canonicalizes every
parent of the guest folder (blocked `/Users/<host>`); guest jobs now rely on
Popen cwd, matching the Interactive launch. Claude guest TUI no longer waits
only on SessionStart: seed a filtered `$HOME/.claude.json` (onboarding +
oauth, never the host `projects` map) so the first-run theme/login wizard
does not block the pane; if it still appears, dismiss it and treat the idle
footer as ready. Guest tmux panes are never evicted to make room for the
host account's fleet cap.

**2.8.12** Guest HOME stubs for host-secret dirs (`.ssh`, `.Trash`, `.azure`,
`.android`, `.V2rayU`, plus `.aws` / `.gnupg` / `.kube`): empty folders in
the sandbox, never a copy of the host tree. Apps that look in ``~`` hit
the guest HOME; the jail still blocks `/Users/…/<dir>`.

**2.8.11** Guest HOME gets an empty `~/.ssh` (mode 0700). Host keys are
never copied; host `~/.ssh` stays outside the jail.

**2.8.10** Guest Claude TUI: copy `tui-plugin/agentremote-bridge` into
`<guest>/.agentremote/tui-plugin/` and pass that as `--plugin-dir`. The
host plugin sits under `~/Developer`, which deny-default `sandbox-exec`
cannot read, so SessionStart never fired and the TUI never became ready.

**2.8.9** Guest Grok TUI starts again: do not nest `grok --sandbox workspace`
inside `sandbox-exec` (canonicalize of the guest root gets EPERM and grok
refuses to launch). The daemon jail is the filesystem confinement;
`GROK_SANDBOX=off` / `--sandbox off` so a host env cannot re-enable it.

**2.8.8** Guest macOS confinement is deny-default `sandbox-exec` (imports
Apple `system.sb` so dyld/mach still work), not allow-default plus a
folder denylist. `!` / `POST /api/shell` and harness children all run
inside that jail; a missing profile fails closed instead of `cd`-only.
Guest `trusted_folders.toml` is rewritten to the guest root only (no
longer a copy of the operator's Developer trees).

**2.8.7** Guest macOS seatbelt no longer leaves the rest of `$HOME` readable:
`!` / `POST /api/shell` and sandboxed harnesses cannot list `~/.ssh` or write
outside the guest folder. The profile denies `/Users` and `/Volumes` except
the guest root (plus read-only harness install trees). Guest roots equal to
the host home are rejected.

**2.8.6** Chunked attachments: `POST /api/attachments?name=&upload_id=&index=&total=`
assembles a file from short POSTs so a Cloudflare ~100s HTTP timeout no
longer kills an 11 MB upload as a browser "Network error during upload".
Ping advertises `"chunked_upload": true` and `max_upload_mb`. Truncated
uploads no longer 500 with BrokenPipe after the tunnel cancels.

**2.8.5** Guest Grok sessions: `GET/POST /api/sessions/job:<jobid>` (and
`…/messages`, `…/continue`) resolve to the harness uuid once the job knows
it, so a client that stays on the new-session placeholder no longer 404s
"session not found" after the turn. Grok session discovery reads the guest
``<root>/.grok`` store (not the host ``~/.grok``) when ``--session-id`` is
ignored inside the sandbox.

**2.8.2** DeepSeek no longer requires you to start `dsh web` yourself: if the
configured loopback URL (`dsh_url`, default `http://127.0.0.1:3080`) already
answers `session.list`, the daemon adopts it; otherwise it starts
`dsh web --host 127.0.0.1 --port …` (log `~/.agentremoted/dsh-web.log`, pid
file so a daemon restart re-attaches). A remote `dsh_url` is adopt-only.
Set `"dsh_manage": false` to keep the old "start it yourself" behaviour.

**2.8.1** DeepSeek transcript + process view: dsh injects `<system-reminder>` /
`<task-notification>` / `<monitor-event>` blocks as user-role history events
the human never typed — the DeepSeek provider now strips them (matching the
Claude / Grok providers) so the transcript, previews, and share links only
show real user text. Process view (`?detail=steps`) is now wired to dsh's real
content-block model: tool calls live inside `assistant/message` blocks and
results arrive as `tool/result` events, so the phone shows tool_use /
tool_result / thinking rows (canonical `steps` format) and can expand truncated
bodies via `GET /api/sessions/<id>/steps/<ref>`. The live transcript stream
shows only user-visible text — dsh `reasoning` blocks no longer leak into
normal view (they stay thinking steps in process view). Sending a new prompt
while a DeepSeek turn is running now queues it behind that job instead of
starting a second concurrent dsh turn: `/api/sessions/<id>/continue` routes
into the in-flight job's queue (`running_for_session`), so a follow-up prompt
is no longer dropped with `agent-busy`.
**2.8.0** DeepSeek Harness (`dsh web`) as a fourth provider: the daemon is a
localhost client of `http://127.0.0.1:3080/api` (list / history / prompt /
cancel / models). Add `"deepseek"` to `providers`. Do not expose :3080. No
TUI / Live TUI. From 2.8.2 the daemon starts `dsh web` when it is not
already running.
**2.7.0** session share: `POST /api/sessions/<id>/share` mints a 7-day
read-only token; `GET /share/<token>` is a hosted transcript viewer (same
look as the web client) and `GET /api/share/<token>` returns that session
only. Ping advertises `"share": true`. The token is not the daemon auth
token and cannot be pointed at another session. LILYGO does not mint links.
**2.6.5** drop Inbox: skip macOS `~/Public/Drop Box` in listings; allow
recursive folder delete via `POST /api/drop/<name>/delete` (still confined to
the drop dir; Drop Box and the drop root itself are protected).
**2.6.4** process-view steps carry an optional `lang` (from file path or
body kind: `diff` / `bash` / `python` / …) so clients can syntax-highlight
Read/Write bodies and Edit diffs. Web process view uses the same tokeniser
as fenced markdown blocks.
**2.6.3** process view (`?detail=steps`) smart-formats tool bodies on the
daemon: Bash shows description + command, Edit/search_replace shows a
unified diff, Write shows path + body; results unwrap Grok
SearchReplace/Bash/ListDir envelopes to the success line or shell output
instead of dumping JSON. Unknown shapes still pretty-print. Claude, Grok
and Codex all use `agentremoted.steps.format_tool_use` /
`format_tool_result` (window + expand endpoint).
**2.6.2** live-status `tool_detail` / `phase_detail` prefer a tool's human
`description` (Bash, `run_terminal_command`, …) over the raw `command`, so
the banner stays short; falls back to command/path when description is
absent. Same key order on Claude, Grok, and Codex detail helpers.
**2.6.1** interactive TUIs move to a private tmux socket named after
`$AGENTREMOTED_HOME` (`config.tmux_socket`), the `_adopt_or_reap` reapers no
longer kill unrecognised sessions, and tmux-server creation is serialised —
three causes of `claude TUI exited mid-turn`. Adds `$AGENTREMOTED_HOME/tmux`,
a generated wrapper for reaching the fleet (`~/.agentremoted/tmux ls`).
Drop folders: `/api/drop` lists directories (`type`, `entries`) and
`GET /api/drop/<name>` zips one on the fly (temp archive, deleted after the
transfer). Process view: `?detail=steps` on
`/api/sessions/<id>/messages` attaches tool calls, results and thinking to
the messages they happened between, with `GET /api/sessions/<id>/steps/<ref>`
for the full text behind a truncated one — Claude, Grok and Codex alike
(`agentremoted/steps.py` owns the shape). Without `detail=steps` the
response is unchanged.
**2.6.0** optional scoped tokens via `$AGENTREMOTED_HOME/guests.json` (folder
isolation + harness allow-list), plus Focus: `/api/focus`, focus membership +
state tags on session rows, session rename / retitle, and `"focus": true` on
`/api/ping`. **2.5.3** adds `auth` on `/api/ping`.

| provider | sessions from | runs turns with |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| `claude` | `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` | `claude` (headless or interactive TUI) |
| `grok`   | `~/.grok/sessions/<group>/<id>/` | `grok` (headless or interactive TUI) |
| `codex`  | `~/.codex` state / rollouts | `codex exec` / interactive TUI |
| `deepseek` | `dsh web` `/api` on localhost (adopted or daemon-started) | `session.prompt` / `session.cancel` |

Everything CLI-specific lives in `agentremoted/providers/`. Queue, stop,
permission bridge, and status streams are shared.

---

## Launch the daemon

### Prerequisites

- Python 3 on `PATH`
- Harness CLIs for the entries in `"providers"` on `PATH` for the same user
  that runs the daemon

### Config and token

Default home: **`~/.agentremoted`** (override with env `AGENTREMOTED_HOME`).

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.agentremoted
cp ../deploy/config.example.json ~/.agentremoted/config.json
# Trim "providers" to the CLIs you have; keep the multi shape.
```

On first run the daemon creates **`~/.agentremoted/token`**. Show it:

```bash
cd /path/to/bb10-remote/daemon
PYTHONPATH=. python3 -m agentremoted --print-token
```

Clients send that value as `X-Auth-Token`, `Authorization: Bearer …`, or
`?token=`.

### Foreground (macOS, Linux, anywhere)

```bash
cd /path/to/bb10-remote/daemon
PYTHONPATH=. python3 -m agentremoted
```

```bash
curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:8473/api/ping"
```

---

### macOS — launchd (recommended)

Script: [`scripts/install-launchd.sh`](scripts/install-launchd.sh)

```bash
cd /path/to/bb10-remote/daemon
./scripts/install-launchd.sh          # install / update + start
./scripts/install-launchd.sh --remove # stop and uninstall
```

| | Path / value |
|--|--|
| Client URL | `http://127.0.0.1:8473` |
| Token | `~/.agentremoted/token` |
| Config | `~/.agentremoted/config.json` |
| Log | `~/.agentremoted/daemon.log` |
| Label | `com.agentremoted` |

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8473/api/ping
tail -f ~/.agentremoted/daemon.log
launchctl print "gui/$(id -u)/com.agentremoted"
launchctl kickstart -k "gui/$(id -u)/com.agentremoted"
```

---

### Linux — systemd

#### A) Deploy script

From the repo root:

```bash
./deploy/deploy.sh user@your-host
# KEY=~/.ssh/your_key PORT=8473 PROVIDERS=claude,grok,codex ./deploy/deploy.sh user@host
# Only Grok on a VPS:  PROVIDERS=grok PORT=2096 ./deploy/deploy.sh user@host
```

Copies `daemon/` + units to **`/opt/bb10-remote`**, writes multi-shaped
`/root/.agentremoted/config.json`, enables **`agentremoted`**.

```bash
systemctl status agentremoted
journalctl -u agentremoted -f
cat /root/.agentremoted/token
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8473/api/ping
```

#### B) Manual install

Stock unit ([`deploy/agentremoted.service`](../deploy/agentremoted.service)):

| Setting | Value |
|---------|--------|
| Code | `/opt/bb10-remote/daemon` |
| Home | `/root/.agentremoted` |
| Start | `/usr/bin/python3 -m agentremoted` |

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/bb10-remote
sudo cp -a daemon deploy /opt/bb10-remote/

sudo mkdir -p /root/.agentremoted
sudo cp /opt/bb10-remote/deploy/config.example.json \
        /root/.agentremoted/config.json

sudo cp /opt/bb10-remote/deploy/agentremoted.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now agentremoted
```

**Non-root / different paths:** edit `WorkingDirectory=`,
`Environment=AGENTREMOTED_HOME=…`, `PYTHONPATH=…`, optional `User=`.

---

## Multi provider model

```json
{ "providers": ["claude", "grok", "codex"], "port": 8473 }
```

- One client profile → host **root**
- `GET /api/ping` → `multi: true` when more than one provider, plus
  `providers` and per-harness `provider_details`
- Sessions merged; each row has `provider`
- `POST /api/sessions/new` requires `"provider": "claude"|"grok"|"codex"|"deepseek"`

Path mounts (`/claude/…`, `/grok/…`) still work. `/internal/permission` and
`/internal/hook` stay unprefixed (MCP / TUI).

If `"providers"` is empty, a single `"provider"` string is still accepted as a
fallback so an empty config can start; install scripts always write
`"providers"`.

## Execution modes

| Mode | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| **Interactive** | Host TUI / permission callbacks; phone can Allow/Deny and answer questions |
| **Headless** | Non-interactive CLI flags (auto-approve style) |

Exact flags are per provider under `agentremoted/providers/`. Caps from
`/api/ping` tell the UI what to offer.

```

### Focus

The projects you are actually carrying, so a session you forgot about does not
sink out of a recency-sorted list. Clients treat it as a *filter* over the one
session list — same rows, same layout, plus a state tag.

Rows on `/api/sessions` gain two fields: `focus` (is this row in Focus) and
`focus_state`, one of:

| `focus_state` | meaning | what it wants |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `needs_answer` | blocked on you: an AskUserQuestion (phase `asking`), a plan approval, or a tool permission | answer it |
| `failed` | the latest turn ended in an error | look at it |
| `working` | a turn is running | nothing |
| `turn_finished` | the turn ended cleanly | decide the next step |

Tested in that order, because the states overlap — a running turn blocked on a
question is `needs_answer`, not `working`. There is deliberately no read/unread
split: whether you have opened a finished turn is not a property of the session.
`failed` reads the in-memory job list, so it is forgotten if the job is evicted
or the daemon restarts, and the row falls back to `turn_finished`.

Membership is **opt-in by human action**: a row appears only when a turn is
started, continued, typed into, or queued *through the daemon* — every one of
those handlers sits behind the auth gate. Agent-initiated traffic arrives on
`/internal/*`, which is handled before that gate, so subagents, hook posts and
permission callbacks can never enrol anything. Marking done removes the row;
the session itself is untouched and stays in the full list.

State is never stored — it is derived per request from live job state plus the
read cursor, so a tag cannot go stale. Membership, the cursor and title
overrides live in `focus.json` beside the config, shared by every client of the
daemon so Focus looks the same on web, phone, BlackBerry and the pager.
`/api/ping` reports `"focus": true`; clients gate the mode on it.

Cap `live_tui` on `/api/ping` when the harness can host a tmux TUI. Clients
poll `GET …/tui` (~2–5 Hz; plain by default, `?ansi=1` for colour) and send
keys via `POST …/tui/keys`.

### Mid-turn resume after daemon restart

Interactive turns (tmux TUIs) survive a clean daemon restart:

1. Running job snapshots are written every few seconds to
   `~/.agentremoted/active-jobs-<provider>.json`.
2. On startup the daemon re-adopts live tmux sessions (`tuis.json` /
   `grok-tuis.json` / `codex-tuis.json`), then rehydrates those jobs and
   continues watching the same host TUI **without re-sending the prompt**.
3. Clients keep polling the same `job_id` — Live TUI and the status banner
   reconnect automatically.

Headless (`-p` / subprocess) turns cannot resume: the CLI process dies with
the old daemon. Those jobs finish as `error` with a short notice.

Use systemd `KillMode=process` (see `deploy/agentremoted.service`) so restart
does not kill the tmux server.

### Rewind

A prompt of `/rewind [N]` (N defaults to 1) never reaches the harness: the
daemon rewinds the session N user messages by editing the harness's own
session journal, then the next turn resumes from the rewound point.

* claude — the session transcript (`~/.claude/projects/…/<id>.jsonl`) is cut
  at the Nth-last human message on the active `parentUuid` branch.
* grok — the daemon appends grok's own `rewind_marker` record (the same one
  its TUI /rewind writes) to `updates.jsonl`; grok honors it on `--resume`.
* codex — the rollout JSONL is truncated at the turn boundary of the
  Nth-last `user_message`.

Conversation only: file changes on the host are never reverted. Works in
BOTH execution modes (the journals are what `--resume` replays); a live
interactive TUI for the session is killed first and the next turn respawns
it resumed. A one-deep `*.rewind-bak` copy is left next to claude/codex
files as a safety net. Advertised as the per-harness `rewind` cap and as
`/rewind` in `slash_commands`.

### Whose sessions get listed

Human-started sessions only (subagents / empty shells filtered). `&all=1`
shows everything. Lookups by id never filter.

### Host→phone file drop

Default: **`~/Public`** on macOS, **`~/.agentremoted/drop`** elsewhere
(`"drop_dir"` in config).

Auth: `X-Auth-Token` / `Authorization: Bearer` / `?token=`.
