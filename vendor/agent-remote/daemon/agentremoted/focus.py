"""Focus list state — the projects the human is actively carrying.

The session list is *derived*: every row comes from an on-disk transcript the
agent CLI wrote, so the daemon owns no session record it could hang a flag on.
This module adds the two things that cannot be derived from a transcript:

  * membership — the human enrolled this session by acting on it *through the
    daemon* (created it, or sent it a prompt), and has not marked it done;
  * title overrides — a manual rename, or a regenerated title, that outlives
    whatever the provider's own titling produced.

Membership is opt-in by human action, never by inference. ``enroll()`` is only
ever called from request handlers that sit behind the auth gate in
``server.py``, so the work an agent does on its own initiative — hook posts on
``/internal/hook``, permission callbacks, subagent transcripts — can never put
a card on the list. That asymmetry is the whole point of the feature: Focus is
a list of *your* commitments, not a log of everything that ran.

Focus is a *filter*, not a second layout: clients keep painting the one session
list they already have, narrowed to members and with the state tag below added
to each row.

State is the opposite of membership: always derived, never stored. A row's
state is a pure function of live job state, computed fresh on each request
(:func:`state_for`), so the tag cannot drift out of sync with what the session
is actually doing.
