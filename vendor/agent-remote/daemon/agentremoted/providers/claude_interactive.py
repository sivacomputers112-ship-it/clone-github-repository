"""Interactive mode: drive a real `claude` TUI inside tmux.

Why this exists: headless `claude -p` cannot use claude.ai connectors (their
OAuth lives account-side; the servers hang in "pending" forever), while the
interactive TUI connects them all. So the phone gets a second execution mode
("interactive"): the daemon keeps one detached tmux session per claude
session (parallel conversations in the same project each get their own TUI)
running the genuine TUI, types the prompt into it, and reads the turn back.

Signalling (patterned after the flipper-claude-buddy bridge): a companion
plugin (daemon/tui-plugin/agentremote-bridge) is loaded into daemon-spawned TUIs
via `--plugin-dir`, its hooks POSTing every lifecycle event to this daemon's
/internal/hook endpoint — SessionStart (session id + transcript path; a TUI
`--resume` forks a new id exactly like -p), Stop (turn finished), Notification
(waiting on input), SessionEnd, and compaction markers. The hook script only
acts when AGENTREMOTE_HOOK_URL (with the auth secret) is in its environment, which
the daemon injects at launch — the user's own claude sessions are untouched.

The turn's events are NOT screen-scraped: the TUI appends the same JSONL
transcript the headless stream mirrors, so we tail the file and reuse the
assistant-message shapes (text / tool_use / thinking blocks). A phone-side
Stop sends Escape into the pane, the TUI's interrupt key.

Prompts starting with "!" or "/" are handled natively by the TUI: "!" is sent
as a keypress (flipping the input into bash mode) before the rest is pasted,
"/" pastes as-is (the TUI parses commands on submit). Neither necessarily
runs the model, so those turns may end on a quiet period after their
transcript output instead of a Stop hook; a /command that shows a UI panel
(/cost, /mcp...) gets snapshotted for the phone and dismissed with Escape.

The TUI runs with --permission-mode bypassPermissions, which was assumed to
remove permission prompts entirely. It does not. Bypass skips allow/ask
evaluation, but a `Read()` deny rule still arms the static Bash guards
(cd-compound-read/write/redirect), and commands whose arguments cannot be
analysed statically ask regardless — each opens a dialog that blocks the pane
with a Yes/No nobody is there to give. Since 2.9.0 those dialogs are lifted
onto the phone: the pane is polled ~1/s, _permission_panel parses the dialog
into a question payload, and the phone's pick is typed back with the same
Down/Enter driving AskUserQuestion uses. There is no hook for this, which is
why it is screen-read; see _answer_permission for the cancel semantics.

AskUserQuestion is the one panel the model itself opens mid-turn, and it
blocks the pane until answered. Its questions/options reach the phone
(pending_question in the job snapshot) and the phone's picks are typed back
into the panel with arrow keys — hooks cannot supply a tool result, so that
half has to be keystrokes.

The questions themselves come from the PreToolUse hook, NOT the transcript:
on CLI 2.1.220 the tool_use line is flushed only after the panel is answered
(with a panel open, the newest AskUserQuestion on disk was the previous,
already-answered one), so transcript tailing showed the phone nothing while
the turn sat blocked. The transcript path is still handled as a fallback for
older CLIs. A TUI must be relaunched to pick up a new hook — the plugin dir
is read at launch.
